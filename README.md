# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to identify possible optimizations for PyBer using rideshare data from January to March of 2019.
## Results
The data clearly shows that most of our profits are generated in urban areas where there's a much higher demand for transportation services in general, as illustrated by this chart [Here](../TanScotBuc/PyBer_Analysis/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png). However, there's a much greater profit-to-ride ratio in rural areas seen [Here](../TanScotBuc/PyBer_Analysis/analysis/Fig3.png). When you compare the [percent of total fares](../TanScotBuc/PyBer_Analysis/analysis/Fig5.png) to the [percent of drivers](../TanScotBuc/PyBer_Analysis/analysis/Fig7.png) you can see that drivers in suburban and rural areas bring in more profits-per-driver.
## Summary
### Rural Market
Expanding in the rural market is a no-brainer due to the much lower overhead due to more profitable drivers. However, simply adding more rural drivers is only half the solution. We must also increase customers at a similar rate. This would ensure an increase in profits more assuredly than expanding in other markets.
### Urban Market
We can afford to be more selective in our hiring of drivers in urban areas because there's a much lower return-per-driver than any other market. If we had fewer but more skilled drivers we could improve profit margins in what is undoubtedly our biggest market.
### Suburban Market
I believe suburban areas might be the most important for the future of the company due to the great combination of higher volume than rural and more profitable drivers than urban areas. Expanding here would be much easier than expanding in rural areas and I could see us becoming one of the go-to transportation options for anyone in suburban areas.
